# Proposal: Create Home Page Implementation

Implement the complete home page for sercomi.com using Astro components, following the design and structure provided in `sample/code.html`. The implementation will focus on modularity, responsiveness, and adhering to the established project style.

## Motivation
The site currently lacks a proper home page. A professional, AI-focused portfolio home page is essential to showcase Sercomi AI's services and expertise.

## Scope
- Hero section with AI focus.
- Technical Capabilities section.
- Use Cases / Portfolio section.
- Methodology / Process section.
- Integration with existing `BaseLayout` and `Header`.
- Responsive design for all sections.

## Deliverables
- `Hero.astro`, `Capabilities.astro`, `UseCases.astro`, `Process.astro` components.
- Updated `index.astro` to include the new sections.
- OpenSpec requirements and scenarios for the home page sections.
