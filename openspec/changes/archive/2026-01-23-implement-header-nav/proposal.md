# Proposal: Implement Header and Navigation Bar

Implement a modern, responsive header and navigation bar based on the provided design. This includes the logo, navigation links, and a call-to-action button.

## Motivation
The current header is a minimal placeholder and does not align with the desired professional brand identity and user experience.

## Scope
- Header container with sticky positioning and backdrop blur.
- Logo/Brand section on the left.
- Centered navigation menu for main site sections.
- Primary CTA button on the right.
- Mobile-responsive navigation (mobile menu).

## Deliverables
- Reusable `Header` component.
- `NavLink` and `Button` components.
- OpenSpec requirements and scenarios for the header.
